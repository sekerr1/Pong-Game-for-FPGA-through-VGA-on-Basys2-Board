# Pong-Game-for-FPGA-through-VGA-on-Basys2-Board
Pong is a 2-player, 2-Dimensional table tennis game developed in the 1970's. The objective of this game is to move a vertical paddle up and down on your side of the screen to defend a moving ball from entering your "goal" while trying to hit the ball into the opponents "goal", which they can defend as well, to accrue points. In my version of the game, as a players score increases, that same players paddle size decreases to increase the difficultly. First to 11 points wins and then a reset of players scores is called.

This project was built on the Basys2 FPGA board using the onboard buttons as up and down control for player 1 and 2 (4 button for control), while Switch0 is used to initiate the start of the game for each round. Players scores are printed in the upper half of each players respective side.
